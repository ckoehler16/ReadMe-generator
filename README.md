#  Professional ReadMe Generator

## Description:
As a developer I wanted to create and application that would quickly generate a high quality README.md for a new project. When this application is deployed on your computer you will answer questions prompted in the command-line and the application will take your input and use it to create the README.md.

### Installation:
1. Go the the link provided and clone the files to your computer:
    - [Link to Files](https://github.com/ckoehler16/ReadMe-generator)
2. Next make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
3. Once Node.js is installed, make sure you are in the root of your project and run the command:
    - npm init
4. Answer the prompts to create your package.json file.
5. Next install the 'Inquirer' package by entering the following command:
    - npm install inquirer
6. Once 'Inquirer' is installed please make sure that you add the 'node_modules' folder to your .gitigore file so they will not be tracked.
7. Lastly type the following in the command-line and answer the questions to have your high quality README generated for you!
    - node index.js


### Usage
I'll be getting to this later...

### Test
Made sure to create a 'develop' branch to run through the application several times to create the README, inputing different data each time, before I merged the 'develop' branch with the 'main' branch and deployed the application.
